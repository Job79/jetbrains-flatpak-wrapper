| Warning: SDK was updated to @SDK_VERSION@ ! |
---------------------------------------

The platform which @EDITOR_TITLE@ flatpak runs on was updated to a new major version.

You may need to
- Install anew your SDK extensions of matching version (e.g. `org.freedesktop.Sdk.Extension.node10//@SDK_VERSION@`)
- Reinstall PyPI, CPAN and RubyGems packages (due to interpreter major version change)
- Rebuild your projects and their dependencies (due to ABI incompatibility between SDK versions)
